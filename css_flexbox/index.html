<!-- Lesson 3: Assignments | CSS Layout Design

1. Mastering Responsive Design with CSS Flexbox

Problem Statement:

In the age of mobile devices, creating web layouts that adjust and adapt to various screen sizes is crucial. Traditional CSS layout 
techniques often fall short of providing the flexibility and responsiveness needed. CSS Flexbox offers a powerful toolset for designing 
complex layouts that are both fluid and responsive. This assignment challenges you to leverage CSS Flexbox to build a layout that responds 
gracefully to different viewport sizes.

Task 1: Create a Basic Flexbox Layout. Start by creating a simple webpage layout using Flexbox. Your layout should include a header, 
a navigation menu, a main content area, and a footer. Utilize flex-direction to make sure your navigation menu is reading horizontally 
and your main content is reading vertically. Requirements for this task:

- Navigation Menu should contain at least 3 things (i.e. Home, Profile, About) and be arranged horizontally on the top of the page
- Header section should contain a background image and header text
- Header Text should be bold, contrast color and Centered
- Main Content should contain at least 2 different children divs with content and be arranged vertically stacked on top of one another
- Footer should contain at least 3 sections (i.e. Contact Us, Events, Blog) and be arranged horizontally 

Expected Outcome: A webpage with a basic Flexbox layout, displaying a header, navigation, main content, and footer in a columnar arrangement.

Task 2: Implement Responsive Design. Modify your Flexbox layout to include responsive design elements. Use media queries to adjust the 
layout for smaller screens, converting the navigation and footer content areas into a column format when the viewport width is less than 600px.

Expected Outcome: The webpage layout adjusts for smaller screens, with the navigation and main content side by side, while the header and 
footer span the full width of the viewport.

Task 3: Enhance the Layout with Flexbox Properties Further enhance your layout by using Flexbox properties such as justify-content, 
align-items, and flex-grow. Adjust these properties to ensure that the main content area takes up the remaining space between the 
header and footer, and centers the content within the navigation and main content areas.

Expected Outcome: The main content area expands to fill the space between the header and footer. Content within the navigation and main areas 
is centered, providing a balanced and visually appealing layout. -->
